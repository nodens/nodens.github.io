    While this was a Litterary cursus, with Philosophy and Musicology as major,
    I spent a lot of my free time teaching myself how to use a computer,
    discovered the concept of FOSS, installed my first linux distribution, and
    spent probably too much time tring to make a high-end soundcard work on it
    or on IRC, mainly on `#linuxfr` on `Undernet`. I still managed to secure honors (*Mention Assez Bien*).
