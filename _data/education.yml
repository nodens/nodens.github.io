    While this was mainly a Litterary cursus, I spent a lot of my free time
    teaching myself how to use a computer and Internet, discovered the concept
    of FOSS, installed my first Linux distribution, and spent probably too much
    time trying to make a high-end soundcard work with it - or on IRC on
    FOSS oriented channels.
